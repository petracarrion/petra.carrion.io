            <h2>Job Market Analytics</h2>
            A Data Platform Use Case by <a href="https://petra.carrion.io/">Petra Carrion</a>
        </section>

        <section>
            The purpose of this data platform use case is to explore and gain a deeper understanding about tools
            and technologies that I am interested about
        </section>

        <section>
            Even though my personal goal is rather technical. I have also set a business goal for the
            data platform in order to have a vision to move towards to
        </section>

        <section>
            The business goal is to understand the state and trends in the job market by analysing the
            biggest recruitment platform in Germany
        </section>

            Examples of business questions that can be answered with this project are the following:
            <p class="fragment fade-in" data-id="question">How long is a job offer online until it is taken offline?</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">Which technologies are the most demanded at the momment?</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">How the demand for a particular technology evolves during the time?</p>
        </section>

        <section data-auto-animate>
            <p data-id="question">How long is a job offer online until it is taken offline?</p>

            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            Enough of business, let me show you how what this project is from the technical point of view
        </section>

        <section data-auto-animate>
            The project architecture has 3 high level components
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="fragment fade-in" data-id="adquisition">Data Adquisition</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">Data Lake</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">Data Warehouse</p>
        </section>

        <section data-auto-animate>
            <p data-id="adquisition">Data Adquisition</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">The data is adquired via web scraping</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">The data source is the biggest recruitment platform in Germany</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">From this data source, we scrape two entities:</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in" data-id="sitemap">Sitemap</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">Job Description</p>
        </section>

        <section data-auto-animate>
            <p data-id="sitemap">Sitemap</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">The sitemap is format is just plain XML</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">It contains all the job descriptions URLs that are currently online</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">The URL contains the job id, which helps us track when a job is online
                or offline</p>
        </section>

        <section data-auto-animate>
            <p>Job Description</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">A job description is a full HTML page</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">It contains all the public available details about the job offer:</p>
            <span class="fragment fade-in">company, </span>
            <span class="fragment fade-in">location, </span>
            <span class="fragment fade-in">job title, </span>
            <span class="fragment fade-in">and full description</span>
        </section>

        <section data-auto-animate>
            <p>Web Scrapping</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">The Sitemap is scrapped via regular HTTP requests</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">But due to the data source restrictions, we need to simulate real user
                traffic to crawl and download the Job Descriptions</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">In order to simulate web interactions, I use the
                <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> headless browser</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">Both entities Sitemap and Job Description are stored in the Data Lake
                raw layer as they are without any kind of transformation.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-auto-animate>
            <p>Data Lake</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">It is where all ingested data is stored permanently</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">It is located at my computers file system but it could be easily
                relocated to cloud storage</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">It is divided in two layers:</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in" data-id="rawlayer">Raw Layer</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">Cleansed Layer</p>
        </section>

        <section data-auto-animate>
            <p data-id="rawlayer">Raw Layer</p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">It stores the data in the exactly format as it is ingested, e.g. XML or HTML</p>
